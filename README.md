My attempts to make something

UserInterface is meant to be a UI library using the DirectX 11 API
Sculpt is a test application that uses the library

UI library features:
- trasparency
- clipping of child elements
- event handling of Mouse Enter, Mouse Leave, Mouse Hover, Mouse Move,
  Key Down

Other things that you will find:
- Vulkan High Level API inspired by DirectX 11
- Texture Atlas with packing
- Mesh data structure with primitive modify functions
- JSON importer
- GLTF Mesh importer (only supports geometry)
- Simple File System Path manipulation
- Mouse and Some Keyboard Input supports delta time and mouse delta
